# CPU Nov 8 Competition

Hey all! This is our competition for the final CPU meeting. You will have half an hour to work on these problems. You don't have to submit an answer to each one.

Each task has a maximum point value, shown in parenthesees. You don't have to submit a response for each task - just submit as many as you can. Many of these evaluations are quite subjective. Don't worry about it - just have some fun.

## Task 1: Paper Title (20)

Some computer science papers have really weird titles, like "Eye Tracking for Everyone" or "A Study of Meme Propagation: Statistics, Rates,
Authorities, and Spread."

**Your task:**

- Find a (real) CS paper with a really weird title.
- Come up with a really weird title for a bogus CS paper. 

Submit both of these titles, but don't tell us which is which! The four of us will try to guess which one is the real one and which one is the fake one. 

You'll get points for each one of us you fool!

## Task 2: Creative Code (20)

Code can be used for art, too! For instnace, check out my thing ([alan-luo.github.io/planetprocedural/](https://alan-luo.github.io/planetprocedural/)). (I'm a sellout, I know.)

**Your task:**

Using only code, make the coolest image you can.

You will be scored on both the technical impressiveness and aesthetic of the resulting image.

## Task 3: Project Euler (20)

Project Euler is a website for taking on simple programming problems. For instance, here's the first problem:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**Your task:**

- Write code to solve Project Euler problems 1-4.

Submit both your solutions and working code.

Your code doesn't actually have to give the correct solution - you'll get partial credit for a close answer.

You may use any language you like to write the code. Here's the catch - you'll be graded on other things, too!

You will be scored on:

- How many problems you solve
- How close your answer is to the actual answer
- How short your code is
- How nice your code looks
	- Do your line lengths match up? Did you make a hexagon out of your code? Is your code ASCII art?


## Task 4: ALAN IS A SELLOUT AND LIKES TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF (??)

Here's a few facts about me:

- I've been coding for a while.
- I have a mom.
- I gave an SLS talk about computer science.
- I have a favorite Github repo.
- I have a favorite CS-related subreddit.


**Your task:**

- Guess the number of years I've been coding for.
- Guess my mom's birthday.
- Guess the number of slides in my SLS talk.
- Guess the number of stars of my favorite Github repo.
- Guess the number of subscribers on my favorite CS-related subreddit.

You'll be scored based on how close each of these answers are - but the scoring algorithm and maximum value are a secret!

<!--
- Let **Y** be the number of years I've been coding for.
- Let **D** be the 3 or 4-digit integer representing my mom's birthday (May 10: 0510 = 510).
- Let **S** be the number of slides in my SLS talk.
- Let **G** be the number of stars on my favorite Github repo.
- Let **R** be the number of subscribers on my favorite CS-related subreddit.

Give your estimate of 

$$R*(^S\sqrt{Y^D} \ (\text{mod}\ G)\ )$$

You'll be scored based on how close each of these answers are - but the scoring algorithm and maximum value are a secret!
